This program is made to read in a file of varying words and print out the top 20 most frequent words. It assumes that there will be 20 unique words to be able to output properly.
It works by taking in a text file name inputted by the user after a prompt message asking them to input it. It will run through the text file, then count and store each word
separately. It will then remove the punctuation and varying unique characters not apart of the English alphabet. The program will then output the input file, the total word 
count of the input file, and the top 29 most frequent words
